1Q) Exploring the Differences Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
In the world of web development and internet protocols, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the backbone of communication between clients and servers. Over the years, HTTP has undergone significant transformations to accommodate the evolving needs of the internet. Two prominent versions of this protocol are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. While both serve the same purpose of transmitting data over the web, they differ significantly in terms of performance, efficiency, and features. Let's delve into the dissimilarities between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 to understand their impact on modern web applications.
1. Multiplexing:
HTTP/1.1 relies on a single request-response mechanism, meaning that each request must wait for its turn to be sent and processed, leading to potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies, especially in high-latency networks. On the contrary, HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be transmitted concurrently over a single TCP connection. This significantly reduces latency and improves overall performance by efficiently utilizing network resources.
2. Binary Protocol:
HTTP/1.1 uses plain text for communication between clients and servers, which can be verbose and inefficient, especially for large payloads. In contrast, HTTP/2 employs a binary protocol, which reduces overhead and enables more compact representations of headers and data. This binary framing contributes to improved parsing efficiency and faster transmission of information.
3. Header Compression:
Another enhancement introduced in HTTP/2 is header compression, which minimizes redundant data transmission by compressing HTTP headers. In HTTP/1.1, headers are sent with each request and response, consuming bandwidth and increasing latency, particularly for repetitive headers. With header compression in HTTP/2, redundant header fields are eliminated or represented using indexed references, resulting in reduced overhead and faster communication.
4. Server Push:
HTTP/2 introduces server push, a feature that allows servers to proactively send resources to clients before they are requested. This capability eliminates the need for multiple round trips to fetch dependent resources, such as CSS, JavaScript, or images, thereby reducing page load times and improving perceived performance. In contrast, HTTP/1.1 requires separate requests for each resource, leading to potential delays and inefficiencies.

5. Prioritization:
HTTP/2 enables request prioritization, allowing clients to specify the importance of individual resources. This feature ensures that critical resources are delivered promptly, even in scenarios where multiple requests are competing for bandwidth. In HTTP/1.1, requests are processed in the order they are received, without any inherent prioritization mechanism, which can lead to suboptimal performance, especially in complex web applications.
Conclusion:
In summary, the transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 represents a significant leap in web protocol technology, offering notable improvements in performance, efficiency, and functionality. By leveraging multiplexing, binary framing, header compression, server push, and prioritization, HTTP/2 addresses many of the limitations inherent in its predecessor, paving the way for faster, more responsive web experiences. While adoption of HTTP/2 continues to grow, it's essential for developers and network administrators to understand its capabilities and best practices to fully harness its potential in modern web applications.


2Q) Demystifying Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript
In the realm of JavaScript, objects are fundamental entities that play a pivotal role in defining the structure and behavior of programs. Understanding how objects are represented internally is essential for harnessing the full power of JavaScript and building efficient and robust applications. In this blog, we'll delve into the concept of objects and explore their internal representation in JavaScript.
What are Objects in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, arrays, and primitives. Objects in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can be modified by adding or removing properties and methods at runtime.
Internal Representation of Objects:
Internally, JavaScript engines implement objects using various data structures and mechanisms to optimize performance and memory usage. While the exact implementation may vary across different engines (e.g., V8, SpiderMonkey, JavaScriptCore), some common principles apply.

1. Hash Tables:
Objects in JavaScript are often implemented using hash tables (also known as hash maps or dictionaries) to store key-value pairs efficiently. Hash tables provide constant-time access to properties, making property lookup and assignment fast and efficient.
2. Property Descriptors:
Each property of an object in JavaScript is associated with a property descriptor, which defines various attributes such as value, writable, enumerable, and configurable. These descriptors are used to control the behavior of properties and influence how they can be accessed and modified.
3. Hidden Classes and Inline Caching:
JavaScript engines utilize optimization techniques like hidden classes and inline caching to improve object property access performance. Hidden classes are internal representations of object structures used by the engine to optimize property access and reduce memory overhead. Inline caching, on the other hand, caches property access operations, speeding up subsequent accesses to the same properties.
4. Prototype Chain:
Objects in JavaScript can be linked together through a prototype chain, where each object has a reference to its prototype object. When a property is accessed on an object, if the property is not found in the object itself, the engine follows the prototype chain to look for the property in the prototype objects recursively.
5. Garbage Collection:
JavaScript engines employ garbage collection mechanisms to reclaim memory occupied by unused objects and properties. Modern garbage collectors use sophisticated algorithms to identify and collect objects that are no longer reachable, ensuring efficient memory management.
Conclusion:
Objects are the building blocks of JavaScript, providing a flexible and powerful mechanism for organizing and manipulating data in applications. By understanding the internal representation of objects and the underlying mechanisms used by JavaScript engines, developers can write more efficient and optimized code. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering the nuances of objects in JavaScript is essential for unlocking the full potential of the language and building high-performance web applications.
